## Welcome to My Code Samples

I wanted to provide some samples of my ability to solve problems with Javascript, Java, Swift and Android. I will begin with Javascript, Ruby and Java. 

### Javascript

So far, I have several small exercises I have completed in Javascript. You will find them in the javascript folder.

### Ruby
I have a coding exercise I completed in Ruby in the Ruby folder.

### Java
I will have a brief REST API I created that will display my résumé. Additionally, I will be implementing this in two, hopefully three different ways, both using Jersey (one as a Jersey Maven project, another as a Dynamic Web Project). I will also share code samples from my refreshers in Data Structures and Algorithms.



Thank you for visiting!
