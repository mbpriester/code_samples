## Welcome to My Code Samples

I wanted to provide some samples of my ability to solve problems with Javascript, Java, Ruby, and eventually Swift and Android. I will begin with Javascript, Ruby and Java. 

### Javascript

So far, I have several small exercises I have completed in Javascript. You will find them in the javascript folder.

### Ruby
I have a coding exercise I completed in Ruby in the Ruby folder.

### Java
I have a brief REST API I created that will display my résumé. One has already been committed. Additionally, I will be implementing this in another way, hopefully three different ways altogether. The initial two implementations will be using Jersey (one as a Jersey Maven project, another as a Dynamic Web Project). 


Thank you for visiting!
